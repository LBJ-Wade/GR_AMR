1. MAY NOT OK for time independent boundary, should add extra entry for finalize function.

2. may need high order space interpolation function

3. initialize PDATA and MDA_ACCESS for all contexts whenever call patch operation function, anyway to reduce the initialization operation?

4. interpolating from coarser level on boundary using a VERY naive way for sommerfield boundary, how to imporove this?

5. almost all class members are public, may need to have a good way to differentiate public and private variables.

6. move all the BSSN operation to functions in bssn class, not calling macros from CosmoSim.

7. currently mixing int and double with user defined variable idx_t and real_t, is it necessary to unify since SAMRAI only supports certain types of variables
