1. MAY NOT OK for time independent boundary(I forgot why....), should add extra entry for finalize function.

2. may need high order space interpolation function

3. weight computing function can be improved by using explicit loops

4. interpolating from coarser level on boundary using a VERY naive way for sommerfield boundary(but it would be rarely used since boundary grids are not likely to be refined), how to imporove this?

5. almost all class members are public, may need to have a good way to differentiate public and private variables.

6. need to find a better way to set the variable chi_lower_bd

7. currently mixing int and double with user defined variable idx_t and real_t, is it necessary to unify since SAMRAI only supports certain types of variables

8. the quadratic interpolation operator does not good enough, we can easily see this by a simple example

9. scalar field currently does not support boundary other than periodic boundary

10. may improve the efficiency of function initializeLevelData() by changing the way of enumerating index?
