1. MAY NOT OK for time independent boundary, should add extra entry for finalize function.

2. may need high order space interpolation function

3. initialize PDATA and MDA_ACCESS for all contexts whenever call patch operation function, anyway to reduce the initialization operation?

4. interpolating from coarser level on boundary using a VERY naive way for sommerfield boundary, how to imporove this?

5. almost all class members are public, may need to have a good way to differentiate public and private variables.
